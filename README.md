# Awheely great time

This project was developed for a university assignment that involved the creation of a game that could have a serious use in the medical industry.

A theme of wheelchair use training was targeted that involved the use of google cardboard and an xbox controller to simulate a wheelchair users environment.

This project was compiled using unity version 5.3.3p4 and has stripped away some of the cardboard specific design and is now a demo for the PC. Minor touchups were performed since the assignment was submitted to increase graphical fidelity and add some features.
